## Write tests

Create your test's files in the root folder of your project.

* `foo.js` contains the test source for the test named `foo`
* `foo.json` contains the mocked response for the `default` scenario of the test `foo`
* `foo.bar.json` contains the mocked response for the `bar` scenario of the test `foo`

## `global` and `environment` variables

You can set your `global` and `environment` variables in the files `global.json` and `environment.json`

Each scenario starts with a fresh and clean copy of the variables.
